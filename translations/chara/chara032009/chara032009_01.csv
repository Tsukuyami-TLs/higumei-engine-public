35,Rika (Casual),"みー、沙都子。
読書感想文の課題本は見つかりましたですか？","Meep. Satoko, did you find the book assigned for your book report?",assigned,
37,Satoko (Casual),"……うーん、こっちにはありませんわね。
確かこのあたりで、タイトルの背表紙を
見かけた記憶があるんですけど。","...Hmm, I can't find it, but I think I did catch a glimpse of the title around this area.","from ""I remember seeing the cover of it around there somewhere",
41,Hanyuu (Casual),"あぅあぅ。ひょっとすると今は貸出中で、
他の誰かが読んでいるのかもしれないのです。",Au au. Maybe somebody else checked it out and is reading it now?,,
43,Satoko (Casual),"だとしたら、仕方がありませんわね。
本の厚みが一番少なくて、お手頃の分量だと
思っておりましたのに……ん？","If that's so, it can't be helped. It was the thinnest book, so I thought it would be an easy read... hm?"," from ""...thought it would be reasonable""",Ok you know what I just redid a large amount of this
48,Nao (Casual),"あら、沙都子。それに梨花と、羽入も。
休みの日にこんなところで会うなんて奇遇ね。","Ah, Satoko, Rika, Hanyuu. What a concidence that I found you all here on my day off, huh?",,
53,Satoko (Casual),"こんにちはですわ、菜央さん。
あなたも読書感想文の課題本目当てですの？","Hello, Nao-san. Are you also here to get a book for your book report?",,
56,Nao (Casual),"えぇ。県主催のコンクールへの選考も
兼ねてるっていうから、ちょっと面白そうだし。","Yeah. They say the book reports will also be screened for a prefecture-sponsored contest, so that seems a bit interesting.","from ""I've heard that has previously served as a screening for a prefecture-sponsored contest, and thought it was interesting.",
60,Rika (Casual),"みー。県のコンクールへの応募を目指すなんて、
菜央はすごい意気込みなのです。",Meep. Nao must be very enthusiastic to aim for something like applying for a prefecture contest.,,
62,Nao (Casual),"まぁ、それくらいの出来になればいいな、って
目標みたいなものよ。実際に応募できるとは
さすがに思ってないしね。","Well, it'd be nice if I had that level of work ethic. It's more of a goal for me. I'm not actually thinking about applying or anything.",so like -> like,"from ""Well, If I had that level of workmanship it would be nice. It's more-so like a goal for me. Actually, I'm not thinking about applying or anything."
64,Rika (Casual),"そんなことはないのです。
菜央の普段の実力だったら、いい勝負になると
ボクは思うのですよ。","Don't say that. I think that with Nao's usual skills, you'd have a good chance.","from ""Don't say that. I think that with Nao's usual strength, it would become a fair fight.""",
66,Nao (Casual),"あはは、ありがと。……でもあたしの場合、
「この時代」のコンクールに応募するのは
出来云々の前に問題がありそうだしね……。","Ahaha, thanks. ...But in my case, I think I'd get wound up in other issues applying to a contest in ""this era"" even before my work ethic would come into play...",Check pls,"from ""Ahaha, thanks. But in my case, it seems like I would run into issues with workmanship among other things in the face of ""this era's"" contest application."
68,Rika (Casual),……？　何か言いましたですか、菜央？,"...? What did you just say, Nao?",,
70,Nao (Casual),"ううん、別に。ところで沙都子たちも、
今回の課題本を探しにここへ来たの？","Oh, nothing. By the way, didn't you guys come here with Satoko to search for your books for the assignment today?",,
74,Satoko (Casual),"えぇ。……ただ、私の当てにしていた本が
どうやら今は全て貸出中のようでして。","Yes... It's just, the book that I was relying on is apparently still being borrowed.",,
78,Hanyuu (Casual),"あぅあぅ、戻ってくるまでどれだけ待つか
わからないので、別の本を借りるしかないのですよ。","Au au, I don't know how much longer we'll be waiting for your book to come back, so I guess we'll have to check something else out.",,
81,Nao (Casual),……。その本って、もしかしてこれ？,"...Is the book you're talking about, perhaps, this?",,
85,Satoko (Casual),"っ、そう……それですわっ！
菜央さんがお借りになっていたんですのね、
先を越されましたわ……。","Wh-, yeah... that's it! So it was Nao-san who was borrowing it. You beat me to it...",started -> was,
87,Nao (Casual),"あー、でもこの本はさっき全部読み終えて
本棚に戻さなきゃ、って思ってたところだから。
よかったら持っていって。","Ah-, but I just finished reading this book, so I was thinking I needed to return it to the bookshelf. You can have it if you'd like.",,
91,Rika (Casual),"いいのですか？
ありがとうなのですよ、にぱー♪","Is that really okay? Thank youuu, nipah♪",,
95,Satoko (Casual),"助かりましたわ、菜央さん。……あ、でも
そうなると菜央さんが読書感想文を書くのに、
何かしらご不便があるのでは？","You saved me, Nao-san... ah, but won't this be an inconvenience since you'll have to write your book report without this?","from ""...be an inconvenience somehow since Nao-san will write her book report with this?""",
97,Nao (Casual),"大丈夫よ。読書感想文は別の作品で面白いのが
あったから、それで書くことにするわ。","It's alright. There are other works that I enjoyed, so I can write the book report on one of those.",changed it to plural so its a lil less awk,
100,Satoko (Casual),"えっ……では、なぜこちらの本まで
お読みになっていたんですの？","Huh... then, why did you even read this book?",,
102,Nao (Casual),"一穂や美雪に勧める本を選ぼうと思ってね。
あの２人、まだ決めてないみたいだったから。",I thought I'd pick out a book to recommend to Kazuho and Miyuki. It seems like those two haven't chosen anything yet.,,
104,Nao (Casual),"ただ……参考に下級生向けの本から読んでたら
ついうっかり読みふけっちゃって。
ようやく本命を読み終わったところなの。","But for reference... coming from an underclassman level book, you'll carelessly get absorbed in reading this. It's one of my favorites that I've recently finished.",,
108,Hanyuu (Casual),"あぁっ！　言われてみれば、菜央の手元の本の山には
上級生向けの課題本も混じってるのですよ～！","Aah-, now that you say it, Nao's book mountain at home has upperclassman level books mixed in~!",,
112,Rika (Casual),"それを全部、もう読んでしまったのですか？
……すごい読書量なのです。
菜央は本の虫さんなのですよ、ちりんちりん～。","And she's finished reading all of those? ...What an amazing reading level. Nao is such a bookworm, inch inch~.","*Rika makes a ringing noise, probably mistaking a ""本の虫さん"" ~bookworm/book bug (lit.) for something else. I put ""inch inch"" referencing an inchworm.",
114,Nao (Casual),"本の虫って、鈴虫のことだったかしら？
まぁそれはともかく……はい、どうぞ沙都子。","You say bookworm, but wasn't that more like an inchworm? 
Well, anyways... here you go, Satoko.",*inchworm instead of bell bug/cricket,
118,Satoko (Casual),"ありがとうですわ。
それにしても……菜央さんが羨ましいですわね。
私はどうも、読書というのが苦手でして。",Thank you. At any rate... I'm jealous of Nao-san. I'm quite awful at reading books.,,
121,Satoko (Casual),"活字がずらっと並んでいるのを目で追うだけで、
催眠術にでもかかったように眠くなるんですの。
おかげで毎回憂鬱で……ふぁぁ……。","Just skimming the lines with my eyes makes me sleepy like someone hypnotized me. Thanks to that, I get depressed every time... *sigh*...","from ""Just from following along the lines with my eyes, it makes""",
125,Hanyuu (Casual),"あぅあぅ、沙都子は開くどころか手に持つだけで
あくびを漏らしているのですよ～。","Au au, all it takes is having an open book in her hands for Satoko to let out a yawn~.","from ""Au au, Satoko just has to have it in her hands and open it for her to let out a yawn~.""",
127,Satoko (Casual),"もはや呪いと変わりませんわ……。
せめて毎ページに絵が３枚……いや５枚ほどあれば、
まだ耐えることができるんでしょうけどねぇ。","My curse has no chance of lifting... 
If each page has at least three pictures... no, five pictures, I suppose I can put up with reading it, though.",,
131,Rika (Casual),"みー。それはもはや小説ではなく、
マンガと変わりがないのですよ。",Meep. That isn't even a novel. That's no different from a manga.,,
135,Nao (Casual),"あはは。それはきっと、興味がわくわかない以前に
本への苦手意識がついちゃったせいでしょうね。",Ahaha. I'm sure that negative mindset towards books is causing you to having no interest in the first place.,going into it -> in the first place,
139,Hanyuu (Casual),あぅあぅ？　それはどういうことですか？,Au au? What does that mean?,,
141,Nao (Casual),"読書感想文って本来は、普段読書に
興味を持たない子が本に触れて楽しめるように
つくられた課題だったそうなの。","Book reports were originally an assignment made for children who had no interest in reading normally, so that they would experience a book and enjoy it, it seems.",,
143,Nao (Casual),"でも、今は先生や上にいる大人たちが勝手に
課題本なんかを選んで、ただ読ませることを
強制する形になっちゃったから……。","But now teachers and adults just assign specifc books to them, so getting to read has incidentally taken shape as something they're forced to do...",,
145,Nao (Casual),"かえって読書を苦痛に感じる子が
増えちゃったんでしょうね。","As a result, I fear the agony that kids feel while reading has multiplied.",,
149,Satoko (Casual),"確かに……それはありますわね。
特に私は、宿題だの勉強だのと言われてしまうと
気持ちが後ろ向きになってしまいますし。",That is... definitely a thing. Especially for me. I get a pessimistic feeling whenever I'm told to do an assignment or study.,,
151,Satoko (Casual),"自分の気に入った本の感想を思う存分に
書いてもよい、と言われたほうが
もう少し読書を楽しめるような気がしますわ。","If I'm told that it's okay to read my own favorite book and write what I think about it as I please, I feel like that would make reading much more fun.",,
153,Nao (Casual),"だったら、コンクールに関係ない
別の本を選んで読書感想文を書くのはどう？","In that case, how about you choose a book completely unrelated to the contest and write a book report on that?",,
155,Nao (Casual),"知恵先生って理解がある先生だし、
相談すればきっとわかってくれるんじゃないかしら。","Chie-sensei is a really understanding person, so I'm sure she'd understand if you discussed it with her, right?",,
158,Satoko (Casual),"それはいいアイディアですわね！
早速明日にでも、先生に話してみますわ～。",That's a great idea! I'm going to try talking to her as soon as possible tomorrow!,,
162,Rika (Casual),"みー、それにしても菜央はすごいのです。
ボクは読書感想文にそんな意義があったなんて
考えもしなかったのですよ。","Meep, at any rate, Nao is awesome. I hadn't even considered that book reports had that kind of meaning behind them.",,
164,Nao (Casual),"えっ？　あ……ごめんなさい、
なんか偉そうな言い方になっちゃったわね。
実はこれ、顧問の先生の受け売りなの。","Huh? Ah... I'm sorry, I kind of spoke in a conceited way, didn't I? I'm really just repeating what my school advisor told me.",,
166,Nao (Casual),"「好きこそものの上手なれ」ってね。
その先生がそう言ってくれたおかげで、
あたしは読書が好きになったし……。","""You become good at what you like doing,"" right? 
Because the advisor said that to me, I started to like reading and such...",,
168,Nao (Casual),"読書感想文を書くのも、宿題じゃなくて
結構楽しいと思って書いてるのよ。","Rather than being assignments, I think of book reports as being pleasantly fun to write.",,
173,ベアトリーチェ (Beatrice),"『……ふむ、それは面白い。
ならば、妾の作品についても感想を
聞かせてもらうとしよう』","...""{b}Hmm, how interesting. In that case, allow me to hear your thoughts on my works{/b}.""",,
