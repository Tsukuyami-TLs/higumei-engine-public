28,ベアトリーチェ,そろそろ時間のようだ。……また会おうぞ、迷い子よ。,"It seems like our time is up. ...We will meet again, lost child.",,,,,
31,Nao (Casual),えっ……あっ、ちょっと……？！,"Eh... ah, wait...?!",,,,,
40,Nao (Casual),っ……ここは、興宮……？,...This is... Okinomiya?,,,,,
42,Nao (Casual),"あれ、あたし今まで何をしてたんだっけ……？
というか、そもそもなんのために興宮に……。","Wait, what have I been doing up until now...? Or rather... why did I go to Okinomiya...?",,,,,
45,Rena (Casual),……あれ、菜央ちゃん？,"...Wait, Nao-chan?",,,,,
48,Nao (Casual),あっ、レナちゃん！,"Ah, Rena-chan!",,,,,
50,Rena (Casual),"あははは、こんにちは。
……買い物の途中？","Ahaha, hello. ...Are you in the middle of shopping?",,,,,
53,Nao (Casual),えっ？　あ、う、うん！,"Eh? Ah, y-yeah!",,,,,
55,Nao (Casual),（そっか、あたし買い物の途中だったのね）,"(I see, I was on my way to go shopping.)",,,,,
57,Rena (Casual),"はぅ……１人で運ぶには荷物多そうだね。
よかったら少し持ってあげようか？",Hau... that looks like a lot for one person to carry. Do you want me to hold some of it?,,,,,
59,Nao (Casual),"ううん、平気。
……そっか、あたしは夕飯の食材の
買い出しに来たんだった。","No, I'm fine. ...Right, I was buying things for dinner.",,,,,
61,Rena (Casual),"そういえば、今日は一穂ちゃんたちと
一緒じゃないのかな……かな？",Speaking of which... I wonder why you're not with Kazuho and her friend today... today?,,,,,
63,Nao (Casual),"一穂は家でお掃除。
美雪は１人で散歩に出かけてるわ。","Kazuho is home cleaning, and Miyuki is out for a walk by herself.",,,,,
65,Nao (Casual),"（……うん、ようやく思い出してきた。
そう、そのはず……だと、思う）","(...Yeah, I finally remember. So that should be right... I think.)",,,,,
67,Rena (Casual),菜央ちゃん……？,Nao-chan...?,,,,,
69,Nao (Casual),"あ、ごめんなさい。
レナちゃんこそ、興宮にはお買い物で？","Ah, sorry. Rena-chan, did you come to Okinomiya to do shopping?",,,,,
72,Rena (Casual),"うん。ちょうど終わったところだから、
これから帰るところなの。
よかったら菜央ちゃんも、一緒に戻らない？","Yup. I just finished, so now I'm on my way back. Do you want to walk back together, Nao-chan?",,,,,
74,Nao (Casual),うんっ。ありがとう、レナちゃん。,"Yes. Thank you, Rena-chan.",,,,,
84,Rena (Casual),"日の暮れるのが早くなってきたね……。
暗い道は危ないから、そろそろお買い物は
誰かと一緒の方がいいと思うよ。","The sun is setting soon... The roads can be dangerous when it's dark, so I think it's better having someone with you when you shop.",,,,,
86,Nao (Casual),えぇ、そうするわ。,"Okay, I'll do that from now on.",,,,,
88,Rena (Casual),……？　どうしたの、菜央ちゃん。,"...? Did something happen, Nao-chan?",,,,,
90,Nao (Casual),えっ……な、何が？,"Wh-... what, what do you mean?",,,,,
92,Rena (Casual),"なんだか、いつもより口数が少ないから……
何か心配事でもあったりするのかな、かな？","Somehow you're being more reserved than usual... I wonder if something is bothering you, bothering you?",,,,,
94,Nao (Casual),ううん。そういうわけじゃないんだけど……。,"No, it's not really like that, but...",,,,,
96,Nao (Casual),……。あの、レナちゃん。,"......um, Rena-chan?",,,,,
98,Rena (Casual),なに、菜央ちゃん？,"What is it, Nao-chan?",,,,,
100,Nao (Casual),"レナちゃんは、どんなに頑張って、頑張っても
できないって思い知らされて、落ち込んだ時……
なんて言葉をかけられたら元気になってくれる？","Rena-chan, when you get depressed because you're reminded of something you'll never be able to do no matter how hard you try, what could somebody say to cheer you up?",,,,,
102,Rena (Casual),"はぅ、えっと……
菜央ちゃんの近くに、そういう悩みを
持っている人がいるってことなのかな、かな？","Hau, umm... I wonder if that means that there's somebody close to Nao-chan that has that problem, that problem?",,,,,
104,Nao (Casual),……えぇ。,......There is.,,,,,
106,Nao (Casual),"（名前と顔は思い出せないけど……そうだ。
あたしにはそういう人がいる……そんな気がする）","(I don't remember the name or the face, but... yes. I feel like... I do know somebody like that.)",,,,,
108,Rena (Casual),美雪ちゃんか、一穂ちゃん……じゃなさそうだね。,"And it's not Miyuki-chan or Kazuho-chan, right...?",,,,,
111,Nao (Casual),"うん。あの２人が相手なら、
どうすればいいかわかってるもの。
だから、こんなに悩まなかったと思うわ。","Right. I would know what to do if it were those two, so if that was the case, I suppose I wouldn't have been as worried.",,,,,
113,Rena (Casual),でも、大事な人なんだね。,But this is an important person to you.,,,,,
115,Nao (Casual),大事……そうね。たぶんそうだわ。,Important... person. That's probably true.,,,,,
123,Nao (Casual),"その人、すごくプライドが高くて、
簡単には本音を見せてくれないんだけど……。","This person is extremely prideful, and it's not easy to figure out what they're really feeling...",,,,,
125,Nao (Casual),"本当はすごく繊細で、
傷つきやすい人じゃないかって感じるの。","I get the impression that they are a very sensitive, delicate person.",,,,,
127,Nao (Casual),"だから、詳しい事情も理解してないのに
変に慰めの言葉をかけても傷つけそうで、
なんて言えばいいのかわかんなくて……。","So, because I don't know their circumstances, I'm afraid I might hurt them if I don't word things correctly, so I don't know what to say.",,,,,
135,Rena (Casual),…………。,............,,,,,
137,Nao (Casual),"ごめんね、レナちゃん。
あたしの変な悩みに巻き込んじゃったりして。","Sorry, Rena-chan. I'm dragging you into my silly issues.",,,,,
139,Rena (Casual),"ううん、そんなことないよ。
……そうだね。レナの意見でよければ
聞いてくれる？","Noo, you aren't at all. ...I've got it. Would you like to hear Rena's opinion?",,,,,
142,Nao (Casual),う、うん、もちろんよ！　聞かせて！,O-Of course! I'm listening!,,,,,
144,Rena (Casual),"あはは、ありがとう。
えっと、そうだね……。","Ahaha, thanks. Umm, right...",,,,,
146,Rena (Casual),"確かに慰めたり、励まされたりするのって
嬉しい時もあるけど……。",While there are times where I'm happy when somebody comforts and encourages me...,,,,,
148,Rena (Casual),"自分で立ち上がりたいと頑張っている時に
励まされたら、その時の気持ち次第では
その応援が邪魔に感じちゃうこともあるかもね。","Sometimes, when you're trying your best to recover and keep at it, that support may feel like a hindrance depending on your current feelings. ",,,,,
150,Nao (Casual),"勉強しようとしてる時に
勉強しろって言われると、
逆に反発する……みたいな？","So it's sort of like... when you're trying to study, and then somebody tells you to go study, so you feel like trying to do the opposite... I guess?",,,,,
153,Rena (Casual),そうそう、そんな感じ。,"Yeah, in that ballpark.",,,,,
155,Nao (Casual),だとしたら、どうしたらいいのかしら……。,"If that's the case, I wonder what I can do...",,,,,
157,Rena (Casual),"……別に、立ち上がらせようと考えなくても
いいと思うよ。",...I don't think you need to think about getting them fully recovered.,,,,,
159,Nao (Casual),……どういうこと？,...What do you mean?,,,,,
161,Rena (Casual),"立ち上がるための力じゃなくて、
立ち上がるための力が出るように、
明るく楽しい気分になれるよう協力する……。","Whether or not one has the ability to stand up on their own, putting on a bright and fun aura for them can help...","Whether or not you have the ability to stand up, putting on a bright and fun aura will help...",not very sure on this sentence.,,"This might be incorrect but this is how I interpreted it since it's Rena, ""Whether or not you have the ability to get up/recover (your mood), putting on a bright and fun aura will help..."", something like that",
163,Rena (Casual),なんて、どうかな？　かな？,"What do you think, you think?",,,,,
165,Nao (Casual),"ごめんなさい、レナちゃん。
その説明だと、ちょっと想像しにくくて……
よかったら具体例を教えてくれる？","I'm sorry Rena-chan, but I'm having trouble picturing what you're saying... could you give me an example?",,,,"vvv I would say, ""Okay, right... Say there was someone who seemed like they were really into their studies, and you brought them sweets as refreshments. How about that, about that?""",
167,Rena (Casual),"うーん、そうだね……。
勉強のやる気を出そうとした人に、
お菓子を差し入れする、なんてどうかな？　かな？","Okay, right... Say there was someone who seemed like they were really into their studies, and you brought them sweets as refreshments. How about that, about that?",,i don't know if this is 'as motivation to study' or 'to somebody motivated to study',"""benkyou no yaruki wo dasou toshita hito"" to me is like, ""Someone who seemed like they were really into studying"" in that moment",,
169,Nao (Casual),……差し入れ。,...Bringing refreshments.,,i think rena used a very weird word for 'sending' in the last line; my dictionary says it means 'sending to a prisoner' so it may be used in a weird way or have weird connotations that i'm not aware of. ,,"""giving someone (who is doing something) some refreshments"" is another meaning",
171,Rena (Casual),その人が好きなものって、知ってる？,Do you know what this person likes?,,,,,"^^^ ""...Bringing refreshments."""
174,Nao (Casual),"えぇ、わかるわ。
そっか、差し入れか……。","Yeah, I do. So it's bringing refreshments......",,same as earlier here,,,
176,Nao (Casual),"ありがとう、レナちゃん。
相手にどう思ってもらえるかわからないけど、
あたし……やってみるわ。","Thanks, Rena-chan. I don't know what they'll think of it... but I'll give it a try.",,,,,
179,Rena (Casual),"うんっ、頑張って。
菜央ちゃんがうまくいくよう、
レナは応援しているからね……！","Yup, do your best. Rena will be rooting for you, Nao-chan...!",,"""Yup, do your best. Rena will...""",,,
