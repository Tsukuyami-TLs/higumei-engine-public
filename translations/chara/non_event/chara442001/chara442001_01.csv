34,Mion,"それじゃみんな、来月公民館でやる
映画上映会のアンケート用紙を配るから、
放課後までに記入をよろしくねー。","Alright, everyone, I'm gonna hand out the pre-screening questionnaire forms for the movies we're watching next month in the community center, so make sure to fill them out before the school day is over!",
38,Kazuho,"……あれ？　ねぇ魅音さん、
この前は確か外でやった気がするんだけど。","Huh? Hey, Mion-san, didn't we do this outside last time?",
41,Rika,"みー。野外だと蒸し暑いし、
虫が多くて大変だと苦情があったので、
今回は屋内でやることになったのですよ。","Meep. There were a lot of complaints that it was muggy out and that there were a lot of bugs, so we'll be doing it inside this time.",
45,Miyuki,"おぅ、そうなんだ。野外で映画を観るのも、
解放感があって好きだったんだけどねー。","Oh yeah, that's right. I like the free feeling you get when watching a movie outside, though.",
49,Satoko,"その代わりに屋内だと、音がよく聞こえて
映画の内容に没頭することができましてよ。","On the other hand, you can hear the movie much better when you're inside, and it helps you immerse yourself too.",
53,Hanyuu,"あぅあぅ、前の上映会ではクライマックスの
台詞が聞こえにくくて、少し残念だったのです。","Au au, it was hard to hear some of the lines during the climax of the movie last time too, so it was a bit of a letdown.",
57,Nao,"言われてみれば、確かにそうね。
その点については、屋内の方がいいわ。","Now that you say it, yeah. Inside would have been better at that point.",
59,Nao,"あと、上映する作品をアンケートで選ぶのも
悪くないわね。興味のないものを観る確率が
ぐっと少なくなるから。","Also, it's nice that we'll be able to choose which movie we'll screen on the questionnaire. It'll be far less likely that we'll watch an uninteresting movie that way.",
63,Rena,"はぅ……菜央ちゃんの前に住んでいたところだと
こういう仕組みじゃなかったのかな、かな？","Hau... was that maybe not how it worked at the place Nao-chan lived at before, at before?",
66,Nao,"えぇ。特に学校での上映会だと、
先生たちが選んだ古い作品を観るように、って
強制的に参加させられたりもしたわ。","Yeah. The screenings at my school in particular were old works chosen by the teachers, and we were forced to watch them and stuff.",
70,Miyuki,"あー、わかるわかる。夏が近づくと、
反戦映画を鑑賞させられたりするんだよね。
んで、その感想文が宿題になったりしてさ。","Oh, I get it, I get it. Like when they have you appreciate an anti-war film since summer's approaching, so they make you write a report on that over break.",
72,Miyuki,"初めの頃はそれなりに観てたつもりだけど、
毎年ほとんど同じ内容のものを見せられると
結構きつかったりするんだよ……。","It's fine watching it that way the first time, but when every single year they make you watch what might as well be the same movie over and over again, it gets pretty tough...",
74,Nao,"面白い映画なら、何回でも平気なんだけどね。
観るたびに新しい発見があったりするから。","If the movie is interesting, I can watch it however many times, though. You can find something new every time you watch.",
76,Miyuki,"うーん、私はどんな映画でも同じものは
一回観れば十分かなぁ。","Hm, for me, it's probably enough seeing the same thing once no matter what movie it is.",
78,Miyuki,"私の幼馴染は、サメ映画なら何百回観ても
飽きない、なんて言ってテープすり切れても
買い直して観たりしてるけどさ……。",My childhood friend never gets sick of shark movies even if she watches them hundreds of times. So many times that the tapes would get worn out and she'd have to buy new ones to watch them again...,
82,Kazuho,す、すごい友達だね……。,Wh-what an intense friend...,
86,Rika,"みー。それはともかく、菜央たちは
どんな映画が観たいとアンケートに
書くつもりなのですか？","Meep. Anyway, what movie do you guys plan to suggest on the questionnaire?",
90,Nao,"あたしは……無難にハリウッド映画かしら？
美術や衣装にこだわって制作費をかけてる
作品は勉強にもなるしね。","A safe choice would be... a Hollywood movie, right?
It can be a learning experience to see one where a lot of budget went into fine tuning the production and the clothing.",
94,Miyuki,"私はやっぱ、刑事ものだね！
特に、警官がマグナムとかの大口径拳銃で
悪人たちを倒していくやつなんかは、最高っ！","Of course it's gonna be a detective one for me!
A cop going on to take down his foes with a huge-barreled magnum is the best!",
98,Satoko,"あの……美雪さん？
まさか菜央さんと同じように、将来のための
参考などと考えておりませんわよね……？","Um... Miyuki-san?
You couldn't be thinking of using that as a reference for your future like Nao-san is, right...?",
100,Miyuki,"んなわけないでしょっー！
私を誰だと思ってんだ、警察官の娘だぞっ！","Absolutely not!
And who the hell do you think I am? I'm the daughter of a police officer!",
102,Satoko,"とはいえ、一番銃を手に入れやすいのが
警察官ですしね……。そういった映画の影響を
受けやしないかと、少々心配ですわ。","But the people who get guns easiest are policemen...
I'm a bit worried that you'll get influenced by this movie.",
105,Miyuki,"ぐっ……！　た、確かにこの国で
銃を表立って携帯できる人なんて
警察か自衛隊くらいだけどさぁ……！","Gh...! C-Clearly, the only ones who carry in this country are policemen or members of the JSDF...!",
107,Miyuki,"現実と虚構の違いくらいはよくわかってるし、
いくら頭にきても法を犯したりしないっての！
美雪ちゃん、ちょっと傷ついたぞー！","But I comprehend the difference between fiction and reality, and no matter how much stuff gets to my head, I won't commit crimes or anything! You wound this Miyuki-chan!",
111,Nao,"鏡で自分の顔を見てみなさい。
あんたみたいな直情型は、いざとなったら
気軽に銃をぶっ放すタイプでしょ？",Look at yourself in the mirror. Do you really think an impulsive type like yourself wouldn't haphazardly fire off a gun while in an emergency?,
113,Miyuki,わーん！　沙都子と菜央がいじめるー！,Waaaah! Satoko and Nao are bullying meee!,
117,Rika,よしよしなのです、にぱー。,"There, there. Nipah!",
121,Nao,ちなみにレナちゃんは、どんな映画が観たいの？,"By the way, Rena-chan, which movie would you want to see?",
124,Rena,"はぅ……レナはこの前ＴＶのＣＭでやっていた
動物観察映画かな、かな。
ネコちゃんが、とってもかぁいかったんだよ～♪","Hau... I wonder if Rena will want to watch the animal documentary they showed on that commercial, that commercial.
Those kitties were so kyuuute~♪",
126,Nao,"そうなんだ。じゃあ、あたしもレナちゃんが
観たい映画に１票入れるわ！",That's true. My vote goes in for Rena-chan's pick then!,
130,Miyuki,"おーい、菜央。さっきハリウッド映画で
勉強したいんだとか、熱く語ってたのは
何だったんだー？","Hellooo, Nao? What happened to earlier when you were passionately talking about how you'd want to learn from a Hollywood movie?",
132,Nao,"いいのよ。だって映画は観る内容もそうだけど、
楽しんで観ることが一番大事だもの。","It's okay. The content of the movie is important, but having {i}fun{/i} while watching is of utmost importance.","It's fine.' instead of 'Well, okay' bc she's saying she's fine with the change"
136,Rika,"みー。つまり菜央の場合、レナと一緒に
観ることの方が大事だったりするのですよ。","Meep. So in Nao's case, watching together with Rena is very important.",
140,Hanyuu,"あぅあぅ、僕はハッピーエンドの
映画が観たいのですよ。
ついでにおいしいものがあれば、最高なのです！","Au au, I want to see a movie with a happy end. And if there's something tasty there too, it would be the best time ever!",
144,Satoko,"さすがにお行儀が悪いですわよ、羽入さん。
まぁ、何かを食べながら映画を観るのも
確かに一興とは思いますけど……、っ？","That'd be bad manners, Hanyuu-san. Well, it might be kind of fun to eat something while watching a movie, though... wh-?","That'd be bad manners, Hanyuu-san.' 'sasuga' isn't being used in the context of 'as expected' here"
151,Satoko,『なんですの、この感覚は……？！』,“What is this sensation...?!”,
158,エウア,……よく来たな、人の子よ。,"...How glad I am to see you, child of man.",
162,Satoko,エウア、さん……？,Eua...san...?,
