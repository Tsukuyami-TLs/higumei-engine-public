## Character name mapping

Character name mappings are in `mappings/charname.csv`.

Each row is in the format JP_NAME, INTERNAL_ID, EN_NAME

Often temporary characters are introduced with setdispname, and you may want to add a translated name for them. 
Put the display name (arg1) as the JP_NAME, and the english name as EN_NAME. If there is furigana in JP_NAME, strip out the furigana. 
INTERNAL_ID can be left empty in these cases.

## Outfit mapping

These are in `mappings/outfits/<name>.csv`. <name> should match the INTERNAL_ID associated with the character. 

These are stored in OUTFIT_JP_NAME, DIRECTORY pairs. Outfits appear as CHARACTER_JP_NAMEï¼šOUTFIT_JP_NAME in the script, and are stored under `game/characters/sprites`
