 narrator 'But... it was relentlessly cut by a blade or or something of the sort, and has been torn to shreds.'
 narrator 'The blood that was pouring down from there, dyed the negligee and the sheets to the point where I could no longer remember what color they were originally.'
 narrator 'The other one was in a gown....  Of course, they were also stained with bright red fresh blood.'
 narrator 'Just like the other, it was torn to shreds.... and looked in pitiful state.'
 narrator 'Out of three beds, two beds were covered in blood.... But one bed was still as clean as it was last night. That was.... my bed.'
 narrator "And I was the only one..... who slept soundly in the same room as the girls.... who wasn't covered in a single drop of blood."
 narrator 'I wanted to ask "are you okay?". But the only thing that came out of my mouth was a small, weak and shaky voice that was too weak to be called a scream.'
