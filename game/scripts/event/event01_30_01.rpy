 'To get to Rokkenjima, we transferred onto another boat at Niijima.'
 'Unlike the ferry, it was a small, fast, boat, so it shook considerably, but was thrilling and interesting.'
 'However............'
 'Mion' 'What wrong, Nao-chan? Do you need to go to the washroom?'
 'Nao' "It's not that......"
 "The reason I'm so gloomy is...... because of her."
 'Erika' 'Well, it really is just a coincidence. At that time, I thought I was going to drown.'
 'Shion' 'Then you ended up washing up on an isolated island with a western mansion. What a wonderful coincidence!'
 'Shion' "And then the handsome young man living in the mansion fell in love with you! It's just like a romance novel!"
 'Shion is...... the same as us, a guest invited to stay at Rokkenjima for 3 days and 2 nights.'
 'We even gave each other the whole "I\'ll probably never see you again" speech. Man, this is really awkward.'
 'Erika' 'Pleased to meet you, my name is Erika Furudo'
 'It seems that Erika had once drifted near Rokkenjima, when she fell out of a pleasure boat.'
 'Then, by coincidence, she washed up on Rokkenjima and was taken care of. And so, she has a small connection with them.'
 'Erika' 'The two twins sisters have already given us their names. Young miss over there, would you please tell us your name?'
 'Nao' '..................'
 'Nao' "I'm... Nao Houtani"
 'Erika' "Ah, isn't that a cute name? Would it be alright if I called you Nao-chan?"
 'Nao' '...do what you want.'
 'Erika' "Well, someone's in a foul mood. Fufu"
 'Mion' "I wonder what happened. Nao-chan's been upset since a while ago."
 'Shion' "She's not seasick is she? I think it'd be best to leave her alone."
 'Shion' 'Leaving that aside, Erika! Which Detective Wanyan case is your favorite episode?'
 'Mion' "A strange turn of fate isn't it! All of our companions to the island are Detective Wanyan fans!"
 'Erika' 'I suppose I am a fan. Even if it is a work of fiction, I both pity and envy anyone calling themself a detective.'
 'Erika' 'I admire the splendid logic, but was let down by the fact that I could have shown an even more brilliant deduction. '
 "The Sonozaki sisters and Erika......san have somehow hit it off. \nI'm the only one left out......haa."
 "We haven't even made it to Rokkenjima, and I'm already getting the feeling that I shouldn't have come."
 'Nao' 'Rena-chan...... she was looking forward to it so much, but she let me go instead, so I have to enjoy myself.'
 'Nao' 'I need to forget about the trouble and clear my head.'
 'Erika' "It might be a bit difficult still, but can you see it? That's Rokkenjima over there."
 'Mion' "Ah! There?! Wow! It's really an island!!"
 'Shion' "......Sis calm down please. Everyone's going to think you're a hick seeing the ocean for the first time."
 'Erika' 'Now, I have a question. Why do you think the island is called Rokkenjima (Six House Island)?'
 "......If it's because there were six houses on the island a long time ago , then it'd be too easy."
 "But it's also that exact answer which comes out of Mion's mouth."
 'Erika' "That's half right. The name comes from the fact that even in the most prosperous times, there were no more than six houses on the island."
 'Shion' 'No more than six houses?'
 'Mion' "Don't tell me, the island's cursed...."
 'Erika' 'The seas near Rokkenjima have many reefs, and the currents are complicated, so there used to be many accidents.'
 'Erika' 'As a result, fishermen avoided getting close to the island, and it became known as a cursed island.'
 'Erika' "Brave people who didn't believe in those superstitions tried to settle on the island many times but..."
 'Erika' 'Mysterious disappearances, strange diseases of unknown origin. The people who moved there were wiped out every time.'
 'Erika' 'No matter how many people moved to the island, before there were more than six houses, they would all be wiped out. And because of that, it was called Rokkenjima.'
 'Nao' "......what the heck, ...... that's scary......"
 'Mion' "Well that's most mysterious! This old man's fired up! It's just like an episode of Detective Wanyan!"
 'Shion' "An isolated island with a mysterious western mansion...... I think it'd be popular if you put it that way."
 'Shion' "We're not just test guests here, we're also resort consultants!"
 "......The Sonozaki sisters really are unfazed. \nMaybe it's not a big deal when you're constantly living under Oyashiro-sama's curse."
 'Erika' 'Although, that story was something I just made up.'
 'Erika' '...the truth is that the island used to be called Akujikushima (Evil Appetite Island) because the souls of anyone who came near would be eaten by evil spirits.'
 '"You\'re sure know your stuff", interjected the captain.'
 'Captain' "Though, rumor has it, there's a witch living there now instead of the evil spirits......"
 'Nao' '.............A witch......?'
 'Erika' 'Fufu......'
 'Nao' "Whatever. I don't care what's living on the island. ......ghosts and spirits, I don't believe in any of that."
 'Erika' 'Oh?'
 'Nao' 'What is it......'
 'Erika' "Don't you think you should be more careful about the attitude towards Rokkenjima?"
 'Erika' 'It is said that the true master of the island does not tolerate those who do not believe in witches.'
 '......I only came to enjoy embroidery in the rose garden rumored for its beauty.'
 'The Sonozaki sisters, excited by the talk of the witch, seemed to be in high spirits even before reaching the island.'
 "I'm not particularly afraid but...... \nI'm not particularly fond of taking a vacation on an island of witches and evil spirits. "
 'Jessica' 'Welcome to Rokkenjima everyone!'
 'Shannon' 'You must all be exhausted from the long boat ride.'
 "The Ushiromiya family's daughter and servants had gone out of their way to wait for us at the dock."
 'I feel sorry about disparaging the island with talk of witches and evil spirits just before being welcomed onto it.'
 'Gohda' 'Now then, allow me to take care of your luggage.'
 'Mion' "Nono, it's fine! My luggage is really heavy!"
 'Shion' "I think I'll let you take care of mine then. Pleased to meet you!"
 'Gohda' 'Yes. Leave it to me. ......nnn ......guh......'
 'Nao' "I've always thought...... you two have had trunks too heavy for just a two night stay."
 'Mion' 'Nfufu. A maiden be suitably prepared when staying elsewhere.'
 'Shion' 'One should be thoroughly prepared for this island.'
 "Here, there's no restrictions like tour bus times or group activities. \nEveryone can enjoy things at their own leisurely pace."
 'I only brought a change of clothes, toiletries, a book to read, and an embroidery set, so a cutely sized trunk was enough.'
 'Erika' "I don't have any luggage for you to carry."
 'Shannon' 'Excuse me. I will now take everyone to the guesthouse where you will be staying.'
 'The only thing Erika was carrying was a lolita-style backpack.'
 "It's like she's just casually staying over at a friend's house."
 'Jessica' 'Erika-san! Long time no see! Those clothes really do look best on you.'
 'Erika' 'Thank you very much. I like them a lot as well.'
 'Erika' 'Last time I was an uninvited guest who had drifted ashore, so I am greatly honored to be welcomed to the front door this time.'
 'Jessica' "Nice to meet you. Um, Nao-san, that's you right?"
 'Nao' "That's right. ......so you could figure that out."
 'Erika' "It's a simple process of elimination. She's and I are acquainted, and two of the three left are twins. The only one left would be Nao-chama, so you'd know who that is."
 "As before, there was some sharpness to her words. It seems I just can't come to like this person, and I sense they don't like me either."
 'Mion' "Wow! An entire island as your home! Man Jessica, I'm so jealous of you!"
 'Jessica' "It's not great at all. Personally I wish I could walk to all my friends' houses."
 'Shion' "Sis! Nao-san! Quickly! Isn't this amazing?!?!"
 'Shion-san, who was free from her luggage, reached the top of the long flight stairs ahead of the rest of us.'
 'There, the view opened up and I almost lost myself in the scenery......'
 'Nao' 'H.......Hwaa............!'
 "The spectacular view truly had me speechless. \n......aah, and to think I'd been feeling uneasy over the incident on the ferry."
 'Mion' 'Thi-......this is fantastic......'
 'Shion' "St. Lucia also had a rose garden but...... it's nothing compared to this."
 'This is what I came for. \nA beautiful rose garden out of this world.'
 '"If I could choose where I die, ...then I would want to be surrounded by these beautiful roses, and fall asleep as if I were taking a nap." \nIt was the type of scene that made you think something like that.'
 'Shannon' 'Thank you very much for the words of praise.'
 'Jessica' "Hehe. Thanks to Kanon-kun's wonderful care, we've had the best roses ever this year!"
 'Erika' 'I would like to express my gratitude to Kanon directly. Is there any way you can call him?'
 'Shannon' 'Your words are too kind. I will pass your message on to him.'
 'Nao' "Such a beautiful rose garden, and no one outside the household is allowed to see it. I can't believe it......"
 'Shion' "Absolutely. In a way, it's an offense to the roses."
 'Mion' "Shion~!! Over here!  Wouldn't it be pretty good if I took a picture from this angle?!"
 'Erika' "The Ushiromiya family doesn't get guests like her much. I'm sure Beato won't be bored."
 'Shannon' 'And this way is the guesthouse everyone will be staying at.'
 'Jessica' 'Think of it as your own home! The rooms are on the second floor by the way.'
 'Shannon' 'Please watch your step and come this way.'
 'Mion' "Aaa, I sure wish they'd renovate the Sonozaki main house into a western mansion like this."
 'Shion' "Do you think the old hag would be fine with that? I can't even see mother letting that happen. "
 'Erika' "Nao-chama. it looks like that's your room key."
 'Nao' '...please stop calling me "chama", thank you very much.'
 'Nao' 'Only one key?'
 "Normally, there's as many keys as guests staying in the room, but..."
 'Erika' 'What a cheap plot. Well whatever, fewer keys make for a less complicated story, which will be nice.'
 'Nao' '......if we end up losing this one key......'
 'Erika' "Don't worry. If that happens please tell one of the servants. They have master keys."
 "In any case, it's an important key. I'd better leave it in the hands of my seniors. \nI'll give it to Mion."
 'We went up to the second floor, entered our rooms and set down our bags.'
 "Our room is a three person room with three beds. \nErika-san's room next to ours is the same, although she's the only one using it."
 'Nao' "......it's a nice room isn't it?"
 'Shion' "You can visit these types of buildings, but it's not often you get to stay in one."
 'More than gorgeous, the room was calm, and had a sense of refined, quiet beauty.'
 'It was built right after the war, so some of the facilities are clearly aging, but that gives it an antique taste.'
 'Mion' 'Hyaaho!! Hoho! These bed springs are the best!'
 'Mion' "I wonder what the view from the window is like! Uwa, you can feel the sea breeze!! Look look, Shion!! It's an ocean vieeeewwww!!"
 'Shion' "......Sis. You're not an elementary school student on a school trip."
 'Nao' 'Mion-san, please close the window for now. The strong winds will bring in dust.'
 'Mion' 'Aa, sorry sorry. I got excited! ......huh? ......uh oh......'
 'Shion' 'What is it? ......eeee-, sis, did you break it?!'
 'Nao' '......eh. Just now when you opened the window in excitement, did you break the lock?'
 'Mion' "I-It's not broken! There's just a trick to closing it, isn't there? .........hmm, let's see........"
 "That's Mion-san for you. I can't believe she broke the window's lock almost immediately after entering the room, let alone on the first day."
 "Well, the window closes on its own. Since we're on the second floor I'm not that worried about being unable to lock it."
 'Shion' 'Jeez, really sis...... you really make me worry.'
 'Mion' "Well...... let's just leave it there! Ahh, what a nice room!"
 'As expected of Mion-san to avoid the subject.'
 'Mion' 'Man, if we got two rooms, we could have invited Kei-chan.'
 'Nao' "Aa...... it wouldn't be good for a girl to stay in a room with a boy before she gets married, after all."
 'Shion' 'Sis you really are an idiot. If you just told him that there were two rooms and called him over,'
 'Shion' "and it turns out there's only one room when we arrive, he'd have no choice but to stay in the same room! Wouldn't that be nice?"
 'Mion' "Aaaaaaaaaargghhh!! I should've done that!! "
 'Mion' 'Shion! Go back right now and switch with Kei-chan!'
 'Shion' 'I never knew you had that little self respect sis.'
 'Nao' "I-If he rejected me there I wouldn't know how to respond......"
 'We leave our bags and lock the room.'
 'Erika-san had just come out and had also locked her room.'
 'When we went downstairs, Gohda-san was setting out some drinks to welcome us.'
 'Gohda' 'Well then, everyone. Please enjoy these beverages.'
 'Gohda' 'I would like to present the refreshing taste of the remnants of autumn, to you who have travelled so far to arrive here.'
 'Mion' "Wah---!! This is great! I'd like a refill!"
 'Gohda' 'Of course, here you are...... Speaking of the fruits of Autumn,'
 'Mion' 'Hwaa---!! This really is the stuff! I drank it all in one gulp!'
 'Erika' "......could you at least wait until Gohda-san's finished his explanation?"
 'Shion' 'Oh well. Sis is a hick with no table manners after all.'
 'Erika' 'Oh? It seems like Nao-chama has no problem waiting patiently.'
 'Erika' 'Do you happen to be a young lady from a good family, dear?'
 'Nao' "I'm not. Your imagination's too good."
 'Erika' 'Fufu......'
 'Shannon' 'Everyone, I would like to show you the mansion.'
 'After the refreshments and a break, Jessica comes to get us.'
 "First, we'll go meet the Ushiromiya family that invited us.  \nThen we'll be shown around the western-style mansion built right after the war."
 'Nao' '......Jessica-san, have you always been living on this island?'
 'Jessica' "Yeah. It didn't bother me at first because because it's been like that since I was born but......"
 'Jessica' "It's really lonely. There's no one on the island but my family, so it gets boring."
 'Shannon' '*giggle* Milady Jessica has been looking forward to everyone coming here today.'
 'Jessica' "It's like having some new friends over, so I'm really happy!"
 'Jessica' "Ask me anything you'd like about this island! Or if you want someone to talk to, or play a game with! Just give me a shout!"
 'Erika' "It's splendid to spend just a few days here, but anyone would get lonely if they lived their whole life on this island."
 'Mion' 'Just leave that kind of thing to this old man! Especially when it comes to games!'
 'Shion' 'In these few days, you will experience trauma you will never forget for the rest of your life.'
 'Nao' "......Mion-san's club activity punishments sure are something."
 'Erika' "Even if you aren't punished, it will definitely be an unforgettably traumatic experience."
 'Erika' "Because, this is the witch's island......"
 'Nao' '......witch.........?'
 'The masters of the house, Ushiromiya Krauss-san and Natsuhi-san, came to greet us.'
 'Krauss-san was a wealthy-looking, well dressed gentleman. \nHis wife Natsuhi-san was an impeccable lady, reminiscent of the aristocracy of the Meiji and Taisho periods.'
 'Mion' 'What an amazing mansion...... To build a house like this in one generation, I really admire it!'
 'Ushiromiya Krauss' 'Hahaha. It was my father who built this mansion.'
 'Ushiromiya Krauss' 'Normally, my father should come to greet you, but he is busy with his noble research. Please forgive our rudeness.'
 'Shion' "We'll do our best to give a young person's point of view as resort consultants! Please leave it to us!"
 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi' "You don't have to be so formal about it. Please take your time and enjoy your stay at our house."
 'Nao' "......It's a lovely house. ......I wonder if it's the work of Josiah Conder."
 'Erika' 'This house was built after the war remember? Conder died in 1920.'
 'Jessica' 'Apparently it was designed by the apprentice of some great architect named Conder.'
 'Mion' "Man I'd love to build a mansion from scratch! I could fill it with secret rooms and hidden doors!"
 'Erika' "That's right. You could even build a secret room for your mistress to live in."
 'Shion' "It might be inappropriate to say this about someone's home, but if you just close your eyes all sorts of mysteries and suspenseful things come to mind."
 'Nao' "That's certainly...... quite inappropriate."
 'Ushiromiya Natsuhi' "Jessica, Shannon. I'll leave the guests to you two. ......Jessica, please don't forget your manners."
 'Jessica' 'I-I know mom......'
 'With that, we were shown around the house.'
 'At first, we were nervous, but around the end, the Sonozaki sisters were totally relaxed. They started getting excited and talking about how wonderful it would be if some kind of incident occurred here and other such indiscreet topics.  '
 'And then, on the way back to the front door, we walked by a great hall.'
 'And there...... I met the true master of this island.'
 'Shion' '......uwah, what a beautiful woman......'
 'Mion' "Who's that........."
 'Nao' '……………………'
 "I'm not psychic or anything. \n......but, it gave me a feeling."
 'It was...... a feeling of love...... for the woman in the painting...... bordering on, or even exceeding...... that of madness.'
 "It should be a beautiful portrait but......that's how it makes me feel. \nI wonder if I've also...... been poisoned by the cliche of mysteries on isolated islands."
 'Jessica' "It's a portrait of our family alchemist."
 'Jessica' 'According to grandfather, the Ushiromiya family would not have prospered if she had not lent him ten tons of gold.'
 'Nao' 'Alchemy...... occult?'
 'Jessica' 'Well, if she can produce 10 tons of gold with a poof, then I suppose you could call her an alchemist.'
 'Mion' "So in other words, it's a portrait of the Ushiromiya family's great benefactor......?"
 'Shion' "Judging by the aura, it doesn't seem like she's from Japan."
 'Shannon' 'This is a portrait of the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice-sama.'
 'Erika' '......also known as, the Golden Witch, Beatrice.'
 'Nao' 'The Golden...... Witch......'
 'That was the first meeting between me and the witch.'
 'However, this first meeting was preferable to what came next.\nBecause she was still in the portrait.........'
 'Beatrice' '*cackle cackle* Welcome to my Rokkenjima! Enjoy your stay, humans......!!'
