 narrator 'In my dream, I was invited by a witch Beatrice ....that witch illustrated on the portrait, in a battle of wits over whether or not that magic circle prank was possible for a human.'
 narrator "Let's recap what happened last night.\nWhen we returned to our guest room, I found my bed ravaged and we saw the magic circle painted on the sheets."
 narrator "It was a prank that Beatrice plays on those who don't believe in witches."
 narrator 'In my dream I suspected Shannon-san, who went up to our room to check the lock of the window.'

 narrator "Last night, after we found that magic circle, we contacted the servant room and had them change the sheets. I might be a bold person but I wouldn't sleep on a bed like that..."
 narrator 'After the call, an old servant called Genji-san brought new sheets for us.'
 narrator 'I gave him the sheets rolled-up in a ball and said they were dirty.\nI wonder what he thought when he unfolded it...?'

 narrator 'Us three were very surprised last night when we saw the ominous magic circle painted on my bedsheet.'
 narrator 'However, what surprised me more was that it was only me who was shocked the entire time.'
 narrator 'A few moments after we saw the magic circle, Mion-san started to roar with laughter. It was so sudden, I was speechless and feared that the witch had possessed her.'
 narrator '....But thinking about it again, Mion-san probably understood in an instant that it was just a prank mimicking a curse from the witch.'
 narrator "...But of course, there is no such thing as witches or magic. There's no other way to think of it other than a prank done by a human."
 narrator 'I thought it was a magic circle drawn with blood at first glance.\nBut Mion-san immediately saw it was just paint.'
 narrator 'The suspect had prepared a sheet with a magic circle drawn on it, and when they found the right time, they snuck into our guest room and replaced the sheet on my bed.'
 narrator "The real question is....who did it?\nLast night, both Mion-san and Shion-san didn't give any conclusions."
 narrator 'In any case... Whoever the culprit was, there was no doubt it was the work of a human.'
 narrator 'That\'s why Mion-san can casually grin and say, "They\'ve done it".'
 narrator 'Her laughter reminded me of a schoolchild seeing a well-executed prank.'
 narrator 'And when Shion-san heard that, she also started laughing. Both Sonozaki sisters relished in this timely prank.'
 narrator 'Meanwhile I was frightened at the thought it was really done by a witch...'
 narrator '...Although, I think anyone would be at  loss for words if they were subject to a prank of this kind.'
